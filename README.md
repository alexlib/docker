docker
======

A collection of docker recipes:

* **elyase/pyrun**: The smallest docker image for python with only **18.44 MB**.
* **elyase/conda**: A light but fully functional python conda image. This is recommended if you want to use the scientific stack (numpy, pandas, ipython, sklearn) where the conda packaging system shines.
